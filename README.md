# About me :technologist:

Hi there! :wave: My name is Tiago and I'm a data analyst from Portugal with a passion for data and a drive to continuously improve my skills. Currently, I work as a data analyst at Allianz Partners, where I use SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel to analyze data and provide insights to stakeholders.

I hold a diploma in Data Science and a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics for Business. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in the field of data analysis. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out!
